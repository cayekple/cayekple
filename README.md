👋 Hi, I’m Clemence Ayekple

A Full Stack Software Engineer who loves building web applications. I have worked on several University of Cape Coast applications using Laravel and Vue. I recently had a scholarship to Udacity Data Science Nano Degree; I love this program because I'm learning a lot about data and science since most applications I develop collect data. I intend to work as a Freelance Data Analyst in the future.

I'm an ambitious, resourceful, innovative, self-motivated person, and I'm proficient in these programming languages: Python, PHP, SQL and JavaScript. 

Able to play a vital role throughout an application development to ensure maximum accessibility, good user experience, and usability. 

I make time for new developments in my field to keep updated information all the time.
